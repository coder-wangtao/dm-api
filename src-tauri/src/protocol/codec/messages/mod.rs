//! `messages_to_chat_v1` — Anthropic Messages → OpenAI Chat Completions.
//!
//! Covers request encoding, non-stream response decoding, and the streaming
//! (SSE) response decoding.  Extracts the strict conversion previously living
//! in `protocol::anthropic` without lowering its rejection policy: invalid tool
//! arguments fail, unknown roles/blocks are rejected, prompt-cache annotations
//! are stripped only when lossless, and usage is taken from real upstream
//! values.
